Observations:
The correlation between mouse weight and average tumor volume is 0.84 meaning Higher the weight higher tumer volume for mice.
From Box plot we could say that Capomulin and Ramicane were most successful drugs when it comes to final tumer volume.
From pie charts - there were slightly higher male mices than female were used in study. (Almost same)
Bar plot shows that drugs- Capomulin and Ramicane were used for majority of study and propriva had least data points for study.
